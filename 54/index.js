54 - Save the Weekend

Use array methods and the existing podcast data to write a function that
can generate a description for each podcast.

Add the description as a new property on each podcast object, and return
a new podcast array where each podcast has a description.

Each description should look like this:
[{
    id: 1,
    title: "Scrimba Podcast",
    ...
    description: "Scrimba Podcast is a 50 minute education podcast hosted
    by Alex Booker."
}
...
]

If the podcast has more than one host, you can display only the first host.

Stretch goal: Display all three hosts in the description, separated with commas:

Example description: "Coding Corner is a 55 minute education podcast hosted by Treasure Porth, Guil Hernandez, and Tom Chant."
